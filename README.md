# Gearworks — Factory Empire

A Factorio-inspired factory automation game that runs in the browser — with
**server-authoritative deterministic-lockstep multiplayer** and a fully
offline singleplayer mode. No frameworks, no build step, no npm installs:
plain HTML/JS on the client and a zero-dependency Node server.

## Play

**In your browser right now:**
**https://raphi372.github.io/gearworks/** — the singleplayer client,
deployed from `main` by GitHub Actions. Runs entirely client-side; saves
live in your browser.

**Singleplayer (offline):** open `index.html` in any modern browser
(Safari on iPad, Chrome, Edge, Firefox). That's it.

**Multiplayer:**

```bash
node server/server.js          # http://localhost:8080
```

Open the URL, pick **Multiplayer**, create a game, and share the 6-letter
invite code (or let friends find it in the public room browser). Supports
8–16 players per room, spectators, reconnection, and host/admin/player
permission tiers.

> Note: the GitHub Pages site can also join multiplayer games, but because
> it is served over HTTPS the browser requires a `wss://` (TLS) server
> address — put your TLS-terminated server (see docs) in the lobby's
> Server field. Plain `ws://localhost` servers work from a local checkout.

| `shared/core.js` | Deterministic simulation core (browser + Node) |
| `client/game.js` · `client/net.js` | Rendering/UI/input · networking (local + networked sessions) |
| `server/` | Modular authoritative server — `network/`, `simulation/`, `players/`, `world/`, `database/` |
| `prisma/` | Optional Postgres schema + migrations |
| `public/` | Cloudflare Pages edge config (`_headers`, `_redirects`, `404.html`) |

## Production deployment

The client deploys to **Cloudflare Pages** and the authoritative server to
**Fly.io / Railway** (Docker), with optional **PostgreSQL** persistence — all
via secret-gated GitHub Actions. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
